and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

(1)	prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the undersigned's
	behalf, and submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the "SEC") a Form ID, including amendments thereto, and any other
	documents necessary or appropriate to obtain codes and passwords
	enabling the undersigned to make electronic filings with the SEC
	of reports required by Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934 or any rule or regulation of the SEC;

	capacity as an officer and/or director of Intel Corporation (the
	"Company"), Forms 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

(3)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned
	which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such
	Form 3, 4, or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments
	thereto, and timely file such form or report with the SEC and any
	stock exchange or similar authority; and

(4)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
