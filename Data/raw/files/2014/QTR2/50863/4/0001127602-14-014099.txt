	(the "SEC") a Form ID, including amendments thereto, and any other
	documents necessary or appropriate to obtain codes and passwords

	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

(3)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned
	which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such
	Form 3, 4, or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments
	thereto, and timely file such form or report with the SEC and any
	stock exchange or similar authority; and

(4)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
