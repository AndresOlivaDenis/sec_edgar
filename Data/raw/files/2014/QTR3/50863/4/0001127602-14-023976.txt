singly, and with full power of substitution, the undersigned's true
and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

(1)	prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the undersigned's
	behalf, and submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the "SEC") a Form ID, including amendments thereto, and any other
	documents necessary or appropriate to obtain codes and passwords
	enabling the undersigned to make electronic filings with the SEC
	of reports required by Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934 or any rule or regulation of the SEC;

(2)	execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's
	capacity as an officer and/or director of Intel Corporation (the
	"Company"), Forms 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

(3)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned
	which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such
	Form 3, 4, or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments
	thereto, and timely file such form or report with the SEC and any
	stock exchange or similar authority; and

(4)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
	foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of
	benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the
	undersigned, it being understood that the documents executed by
	such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this
	Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain such terms
	and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such attorney-
	in-fact's discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and
powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the
undersigned might or could do if personally present, with full power of
substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such
attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in-fact's substitute or substitutes,
shall lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this power of attorney
and the rights and powers herein granted. The undersigned acknowledges that
the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in serving in such capacity at the request
of the undersigned, are not assuming, nor is the Company assuming, any of
the undersigned's responsibilities to comply with Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until
the undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4, and 5 with
respect to the undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities
issued by the Company, unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a
signed writing delivered to the foregoing attorneys-in-fact.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed as of this 31st day of March, 2014.
