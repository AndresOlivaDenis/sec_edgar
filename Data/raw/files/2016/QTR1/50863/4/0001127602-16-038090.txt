Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and

and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

(1)	prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the undersigned's
	behalf, and submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
	(the "SEC") a Form ID, including amendments thereto, and any other
	documents necessary or appropriate to obtain codes and passwords
	enabling the undersigned to make electronic filings with the SEC
	of reports required by Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934 or any rule or regulation of the SEC;

(2)	execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's
	capacity as an officer and/or director of Intel Corporation (the
	"Company"), Forms 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

(3)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned
	which may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such
	Form 3, 4, or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments
	thereto, and timely file such form or report with the SEC and any
	stock exchange or similar authority; and

(4)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
	foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of
	benefit to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the

	such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this
	Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall contain such terms
	and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such attorney-
	in-fact's discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
