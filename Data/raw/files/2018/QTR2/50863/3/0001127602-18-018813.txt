<TEXT>
                               POWER OF ATTORNEY

Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and appoints
each of Susie Giordano, Fernando Delmendo, Brian Petirs, Leslie Miramon,
Veronique Bourdeau or either of them signing singly, and with full power
of substitution, the undersigned's true and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

(1)  prepare, execute in the undersigned's name and on the undersigned's behalf,
     and submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a
     Form ID, including amendments thereto, and any other documents necessary or
     appropriate to obtain codes and passwords enabling the undersigned to make
     electronic filings with the SEC of reports required by Section 16(a) of the
     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any rule or regulation of the SEC;

(2)  execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned's capacity
     as an officer and/or director of Intel Corporation (the "Company"), Forms
     3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
     of 1934 and the rules thereunder;

(3)  do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
     may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4,
     or 5, complete and execute any amendment or amendments thereto, and timely
     file such form or report with the SEC and any stock exchange or similar
     authority; and

(4)  take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
     foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit
     to, in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it
     being understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on
     behalf of the undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in
     such form and shall contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-
     fact may approve in such attorney-in-fact's discretion.

The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers
herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or
could do if personally present, with full power of substitution or revocation,
hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney-in-fact, or such
attorney-in-fact's substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do or cause to be
done by virtue of this power of attorney and the rights and powers herein
granted. The undersigned acknowledges that the foregoing attorneys-in-fact, in
serving in such capacity at the request of the undersigned, are not assuming,
nor is the Company assuming, any of the undersigned's responsibilities to comply
with Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4, and 5 with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company,
unless earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered to the
foregoing attorneys-in-fact or is superceded by execution of a new Power of
Attorney.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed as of this 16th day of May, 2018.
