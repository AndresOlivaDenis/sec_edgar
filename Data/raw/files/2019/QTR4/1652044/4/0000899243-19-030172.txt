        <footnote id="F1">The Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $0.001 per share (the &quot;Convertible Preferred Stock&quot;), is convertible at any time and has no expiration date. The Issuer may mandatorily convert the Convertible Preferred Stock into Common Stock (i) at any time after the seventh anniversary of June 29, 2016 (the &quot;Closing Date&quot;), and (ii) between the fifth anniversary and the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, if certain conditions are met.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to cumulative dividends, whether or not declared by the Issuer's board of directors, at the rate of 5.50% per annum during the period from the Closing Date to the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date.  Such dividends are payable semi-annually in arrears on June 29 and December 29 of each year, by increasing the liquidation preference of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock.  Accordingly, the liquidation preference of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock increased on December 29, 2019, such that the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held directly by CapitalG LP remained the same, but are now convertible into 5,325,981 shares of Common Stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">CapitalG LP directly holds shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock. CapitalG GP LLC, the general partner of CapitalG LP, Alphabet Holdings LLC, the managing member of CapitalG GP LLC, XXVI Holdings Inc., the managing member of Alphabet Holdings LLC, and Alphabet Inc., the controlling stockholder of XXVI Holdings Inc., may each be deemed to have the sole power to vote and dispose of these shares. Each of CapitalG GP LLC, Alphabet Holdings LLC, XXVI Holdings Inc., and Alphabet Inc. disclaims beneficial ownership of the Convertible Preferred Stock, except to the extent of any pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
