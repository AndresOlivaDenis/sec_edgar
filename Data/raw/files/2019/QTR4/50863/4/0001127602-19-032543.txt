        <footnote id="F1">Each phantom stock unit represents the right to receive the cash value of one share of Intel common stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The Intel common stock investment option, which represents a hypothetical investment in Intel common stock under the Intel Corporation Sheltered Employee Retirement Plan Plus (the &quot;Plan&quot;), Intel's deferred compensation plan, was closed for all participants, effective November 8, 2019. The reporting person was required to transfer all amounts allocated to the Intel common stock investment option into another investment option under the Plan. Accordingly, on November 8, 2019, the reporting person's balance in the Intel common stock investment option was automatically transferred to a default investment option as reported in this Form 4. For the avoidance of doubt, the reporting person is reporting this disposition, which was approved in advance by the Compensation Committee of Intel's Board of Directors, as a discretionary transaction.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Phantom stock units acquired under the Plan were payable in cash following termination of the reporting person's employment or could be transferred into an alternative investment account under the Plan.</footnote>
