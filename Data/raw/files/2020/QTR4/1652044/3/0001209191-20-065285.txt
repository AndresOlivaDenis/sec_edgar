	Know all by these presents, that the undersigned hereby constitutes and
appoints each of Kathryn W. Hall, Kenneth Yi, Nancy Walker, Kendrick Vaughn,
Valentina Margulis, and Fadillah Badar and such other persons as may be
designated by the Corporate Secretary of Alphabet Inc. (the Company), or any of
them signing singly, and with full power of substitution, the undersigned s true
and lawful attorney-in-fact to:

(1)	prepare, execute in the undersigned s name and on the undersigned s behalf,
and submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) a Form ID,
including amendments thereto, and any other documents necessary or appropriate
to obtain codes and passwords enabling the undersigned to make electronic
filings with the SEC of reports required by Section 16 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 or any rule or regulation of the SEC promulgated thereunder
(the Securities Exchange Act), or any successor laws and/or regulations;

(2)	execute for and on behalf of the undersigned, in the undersigned s capacity
as an officer of the Company, Forms 3, 4, and 5 in accordance with Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act and the rules hereunder and any other forms or
reports the undersigned may be required to file in connection with the
undersigned s ownership, acquisition, or disposition of the securities of the
Company;

(3)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
may be necessary or desirable to complete and execute any such Form 3, 4, or 5,
or other form or report, complete and execute any amendment or amendments
thereto, and timely file such form or report with the SEC, any stock exchange,
any national association, and such other person, agency or similar authority, as
a consequence of the undersigned s ownership, acquisition or disposition of
securities of the Company; and

(4)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to,
in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the

	The undersigned hereby grants to each such attorney-in-fact full power and
authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever requisite,
necessary, or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights and powers
herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the undersigned might or

or in writing by the undersigned to such attorney-in-fact. The undersigned
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each such attorney-in-fact against any
losses, claims, damages or liability (or actions in these respects) that arise
out of or are based upon any untrue statements or omissions of necessary facts
in the information provided by the undersigned to such attorney-in-fact for
purposes of executing, acknowledging, delivering or filing Form 3, 4 or 5, Form
IDs or any amendments thereto and agrees to reimburse the Company and such
attorney-in-fact for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with investigating or defending against any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action.

	This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until (i) the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4, and 5 with respect to the
undersigned s holdings of and transactions in securities issued by the Company,
(ii) earlier revoked by the undersigned in a signed writing delivered to the
foregoing attorneys-in-fact; or (iii) superseded by a new power of attorney
regarding the purposes outlined in the first paragraph hereof dated as of a
later date.

	IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed as of December 13, 2020.
