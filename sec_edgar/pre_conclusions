## Pre-Conclusions

- Seems like insider transactions invest is a good approach:
        - Returns seems to be higher
        - On 10 Days timeFrame even in "negative returns years"

- 5, 10, and 21 Days timeFrames seems to be statistically improvements.

- on 5 day timeFrame:
        - Seems like there is not an decay in returns on the foward 5 days

- on 10 day timeFrame:
        - Seems like there is a bit of an decay in returns on the foward 10 days

- 10 Days timeFrame seems to be the best reference timeFrame:
        - Has a good returns increase in positive and negative years relationship
        - Not also that it seems can be extended to 21days!
                (in case minimize cost weigth is needed and/or not enougth transactions signals)

- Other notes:
        - There is not really significance difference with 10+ foward benchmark, so in order to minimize cost weigth in returns (and to maximize exposure in market) only close in 10Days if there is a new other stock to invest in.

        - By days seems to be the best approach (vs by File)

        - Seems to not be significant difference using is_director vs not using it
